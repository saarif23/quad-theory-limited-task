## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
## Note 
It seems like the API is working correctly on the development server, fetching data successfully. However, after deployment, there's a mixed context error, preventing data retrieval. When attempting to solve it by using a proxy API or other methods, it results in a "forbidden access" error. Please check on the development server to ensure it functions properly.
